  You and some of your friends started a business that helps find new homes for stray or abandoned cats and dogs. 
  Your business started off small, with just a couple of strays, but it's starting to grow. 
  You want to create an application that will help you match the animals in your care with people looking for a pet.
  You've found that it's important to have a detailed description of the animals to share with potential owners. 
  In addition, being able to describe the personality of the dog or cat makes them more appealing to potential owners.
  You decide to create an application that helps you manage information about the dogs and cats you're caring for.
